:whale: Docker images that don't deserve a separate repo

TODO Docker images that have almost no custom code (e.g. they are specific to an underlying software)

TODO You can find these on Docker Hub. Built automatically https://hub.docker.com/u/dmotte

TODO see your other docker repos to improve README
