# docker-images

:whale: Docker images that don't deserve a separate repo

TODO Docker images that have almost no custom code (e.g. they are specific to an underlying software)

TODO You can find these on Docker Hub. Built automatically https://hub.docker.com/u/dmotte

TODO add dockerdesc and trivy workflows

TODO see your other docker repos for other stuff that should be added and to improve README

TODO check dockerhub repos created and set stuff, e.g. short description
